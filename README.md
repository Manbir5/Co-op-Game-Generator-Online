# Co-op-Game-Generator-Online

This is the code for an online website the generates a random co-op game after the user has selected their criteria.

This is a web application that allows a user to select criteria on the home page. They can select the console type, the co-op type, and the genre they are looking for. After pressing submit, the web application will provide a game title that matches this criteria and a picture of the game.

This application uses databases to hold the information about the game and uses two seperate microservices for the images.
